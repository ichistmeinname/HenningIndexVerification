# Supplementary Material for "Game Theory, Commutative Semirings, and Free Theorems"

This repository contains proofs of the statements from the paper "Game Theory, Commutative Semirings, and Free Theorems" in Coq. The file `Coalitions.v` contains proofs of the main statements, namely that `sumProd` and `sumProdSpec` yield the same results for all commutative semirings. The file `Vector.v` contains proofs that the operations concerning vectors form a commutative semiring.
